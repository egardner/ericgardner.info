During the "plague year" of 2020 I didn't get many chances to travel.
By the time summer arrived, I felt pretty stir-crazy.

My 36th birthday was approaching, and after months of isolation and lockdown
I wanted to do *something* memorable. Since getting on a plane wasn't an option,
I decided to do the next best thing I could think of: take a long bike ride
on the Oregon coast. Specifically, the 
[Wild Rivers Coast Scenic Bikeway](https://traveloregon.com/things-to-do/outdoor-recreation/bicycling/road-biking/wild-rivers-coast-scenic-bikeway/),
one of a series of special routes that the state has designated.

You can see a [route map of my ride here](https://ridewithgps.com/routes/33594155?privacy_code=ORY1MmZHvKFYlPzr).

Port Orford is a little out of the way from, well, everything (it's about 5
hours from Portland). But that's part of what made it so nice to ride out here;
there was very little traffic, even on Highway 101. Oregon's Southern coast
seems like a very remote and special area.

Starting from Port Orford, I headed north on the 101 and then went inland
along the Elk River Road for about 15 miles. This road went through a beautiful
stretch of forest along the Elk River.

After that, I turned back and returned to the 101. From there I continued north
into Cape Blanco State Park, riding past some spectacular coastal bluffs until I
reached the lighthouse. Finally, I turned back and headed back into town along
the 101.

The ride took all day but it sure was memorable, and it was great not having to
deal with much in the way of car traffic.
