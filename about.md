title: About me
---

Iâ€™m Eric, a software developer based in Portland, Oregon. I work as a
software engineer at the Wikimedia Foundation. I believe that software should
exist in the service of knowledge and that technology should empower instead of
control. Occasionally, I write things.

In addition to my work as a programmer, I am a passionate amateur photographer.
This site is my place to showcase some of my work outside the confines of social
media.

## Colophon

This site is built using [Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org).
It is typeset using the [Inter Font Family](https://rsms.me/inter/), and it is hosted
on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).

In addition to Vue & Vitepress, I am using the following Node.js packages:

* [Feed](https://www.npmjs.com/package/feed) to generate an [RSS Feed of my blog posts](/feed.rss)
* [Cheerio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio) to do some processing for the RSS version of my blog posts.
* [vite-imagetools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-imagetools) for my image processing workflow.
