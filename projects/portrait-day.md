Hi friends! On **Saturday, February 3,** I will be hosting a "portrait day" at 
[Half Court Studio](https://www.halfcourtstudio.com) here in Portland. I have
reserved the space for the day and hope to spend this time making a series of
portraits of friends / family / friends' families. I'm doing this for fun and
with the goal of becoming a better portrait photographer. I will be working with
some basic lighting but nothing elaborate in terms of props or staging. Feel
free to bring any props our outfits that you like!

I'd love it if you could drop by for an hour or two! Children and babies welcome.

This will be a casual event, and I expect folks will be coming and going
throughout the day. However, it would be helpful for me to know roughly when
folks intend to come by so that I can plan accordingly.

If you plan on dropping by, please let me know when you want to come and I can
add you to the schedule below. Also, I know that some of you are photographers
yourselves – feel free to bring your own camera stuff as well, and let me know
if you want to collaborate in some capacity during the day.

Hope to see you there!
